        </ul>
        
        <h4>All-Purpose Marinara Sauce:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil

            <li>1/4 pound pancetta, diced

            <li>2 large Spanish onions, cut into 1/4-inch dice

            <li>Kosher salt

            <li>4 large cloves garlic, smashed and chopped

            <li>4 (28-ounce) cans Italian plum San Marzano                        tomatoes
            
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil.                 Working batches, cook the lasagna noodles until                   they are soft and pliable but not limp, 6 to 7                    minutes. Remove the pasta from the boiling water                  and lay flat on a sheet tray to cool. Reserve.
            
            
            <li>Coat a large saute pan with olive oil and bring to                 medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook until                  brown and crumbly. Remove from pan and reserve on                 paper towels.
            
            
                <li>Ditch the fat from the pan and add new olive                  oil along with 2 cloves of garlic and a pinch of                  crushed red pepper. Bring the pan to medium-high                  heat. When the garlic becomes golden and very                     aromatic, remove it from the heat and discard.                    Toss in the mushrooms and season them with salt.                  Cook the mushrooms until they are soft and wilted                 and dark brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from pan                   and reserve. Repeat this process with the                         remaining garlic and the zucchini.
                
                
                <li>In a small bowl, combine the ricotta, 1/2 the                 Parmigiano-Reggiano, the eggs, and the basil. Mix                 to combine well and season with salt.
                
                
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
                
                
                <li>In the bottom of a 9 by 13-inch deep-dish                         baking dish, add a couple ladlefuls of sauce                      and spread out in an even layer. Arrange a                        layer of the lasagna noodles to completely                        cover the sauce. Spread 1/3 of the ricotta                        mixture over the pasta. Place a layer of pasta                     going in the other direction as the first                         layer (this will give a little more stability                     ). Spread a light layer of sauce on the pasta                     and sprinkle 1/3 of the sausage over the sauce                     , repeat this process with 1/3 of the                             mushrooms and zucchini. Sprinkle a layer of                       mozzarella and some of the remaining Parmigian                     o-Reggiano over the veggies. Repeat these                         layers until all the ingredients have been                        used up or the pan is full. Be sure that there                     is a layer of pasta on top covered with sauce                     and sprinkled with mozzarella and Parmigiano.                     Cover with foil.
                
                
            
                    <li>Place the lasagna on a baking sheet and                           bake in the oven until the lasagna is hot                         and bubbly, about 1 hour 15 minutes,                              removing the foil for the last 15 minutes                         of cooking. Let cool for 20 minutes before                         slicing.
                    
                    
                    
                    <li>Note: For optimal slicing, make and bake                          the lasagna the day before. Heat it up                            again before slicing.
                </ol>
                    
<h4>All-Purpose Marinara Sauce:</h4>

        <ol>
                <li>Coat a large saucepot with olive oil and add                      the pancetta. Bring the pot to medium-high                        heat and cook the pancetta for 4 to 5 minutes.                     Add the onions, season generously with salt,                     and stir to coat with the olive oil. Cook the                      onions for 6 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently                     ; the onions should become very soft and                          aromatic but have no color. Add the garlic and                     cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, stirring                         frequently.
<li>Pass the tomatoes through a food mill. Be sure to pass all of the pulp through the holes leaving only the stems and the seeds, and be sure to scrape the pulp off of the bottom of the food mill. That's all of the big money stuff! Add the tomatoes to the pot and rinse out one of the empty tomato cans with water and add that water to the pot (about 2 to 3 cups). Season generously with salt and taste it; tomatoes take a lot of salt. Season in baby steps and taste every step of the way. Cook the sauce for 2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally and tasting frequently.
<li>Use the sauce right away on pasta or for any other tomato sauce need. This sauce can also be cooled and stored in the fridge for a few days or it freezes really well.
